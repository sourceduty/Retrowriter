### Example Usage

Jessica walked into the bustling coffee shop, her eyes scanning for an empty seat. The air was filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of lively conversations. She finally spotted a small table in the corner and made her way through the crowd, her laptop bag slung over her shoulder. Sitting down, she opened her laptop and began to work, occasionally sipping her coffee and watching people come and go.

Here's the transformation of the modern text into the style of 18th Century France:

Jessica pénétra dans le café animé, ses yeux cherchant une place libre. L'air était embaumé du parfum du café fraîchement infusé et du bourdonnement des conversations enjouées. Elle aperçut enfin une petite table dans un coin et se fraya un chemin à travers la foule, son sac de travail en bandoulière. S'asseyant, elle ouvrit son écritoire portable et se mit à l'ouvrage, buvant parfois une gorgée de son café tout en observant les allées et venues des gens.
